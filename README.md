# Docker Watch

## About
Docker Watch is a containzerized Python script that allows you to easily set up and configure monitoring Docker events. This lets you get notified if (and, lets be honest, when) a container crashes, a service is removed, or anything that Docker emits events for.

### What is a Docker event?
Docker events are fired by Docker when something interesting happens in the lifecycle of a network, service, container, etc. You can read about Docker events and see a full list of supported events [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/).

## Usage
Don't really know about this aprt yet, something about `config.yml` and an install command at some point I guess.

## Contributing
Be nice and write good code and I'll merge the PR eventually :)
